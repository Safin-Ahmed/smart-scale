# K3s AutoScaler (AWS)

A production-grade, event-driven autoscaler for a K3s cluster running on AWS EC2.

This project implements **safe scale-up, safe scale-down, multi-AZ awareness, and Spot instance interruption handling** without relying on managed Kubernetes services or built-in autoscalers.

## Objectives

The primary goals of this system are:

- Automatically scale worker nodes based on real Kubernetes metrics
- Guarantee safe node deprovisioning (no workload loss)
- Maintain high availability across multiple Availability Zones
- Leverage Spot instances safely with automatic fallback
- Keep observability infrastructure stable and isolated

This design favors **correctness and safety over aggressive scaling**.

---

## High-Level Architecture

**Core components:**

- **K3s Cluster**
  - 1× Control Plane (Master)
  - N× Worker Nodes (Spot + On-Demand)
- **Prometheus**
  - Deployed inside cluster
  - Pinned to master node
- **Autoscaler (AWS Lambda)**
  - Poll-based scaling
  - Event-driven interruption handling
- **DynamoDB**
  - State management
  - Distributed locking
- **AWS EC2**
  - Worker lifecycle management
- **AWS SSM Parameter Store**
  - Secure token storage

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Master Node Is Never Deprovisioned

- Hosts:
  - Kubernetes control plane
  - Prometheus monitoring stack
- Tainted to prevent application workloads
- Guarantees observability and API availability during scaling events

---

### 2. Metrics-Driven Autoscaling

Scaling decisions are based on:

- Average CPU utilization
- Pending pod count
- Duration-based thresholds (not instantaneous spikes)

All decisions are **time-aware and stateful**.

---

### 3. Safe Scale-Down (Hard Requirement)

Scale-down strictly follows these rules:

- Nodes are **cordoned first**
- Pods are **gracefully evicted**
- Drain timeout enforced (5 minutes)
- Nodes with critical system pods are **never terminated**
- Minimum worker count is always respected

If any safety check fails → **NOOP**.

---

### 4. Multi-AZ Awareness (Bonus)

- Workers are evenly distributed across AZs
- Scale-up always targets the **least populated AZ**
- Scale-down avoids draining an AZ to zero when possible

This ensures resilience against AZ-level failures.

---

### 5. Spot Instance Support with Interruption Handling (Bonus)

- Workers are launched as **Spot-first**
- Automatic fallback to On-Demand if Spot capacity is unavailable
- Spot interruption events trigger:
  - Immediate graceful drain
  - Proactive termination
  - AZ-aware replacement launch

This makes Spot usage **safe and predictable**.

---

## Autoscaler Execution Model

### Poll-Based Scaling

- Triggered every 2 minutes via EventBridge
- Evaluates metrics and cluster state
- Executes **at most one scaling action at a time**

### Event-Driven Handling

- Listens for:
  - EC2 Spot Interruption Warnings
  - EC2 Rebalance Recommendations
- Handles node replacement immediately, outside normal polling flow

---

## State Management (DynamoDB)

A single DynamoDB record maintains cluster state:

- Scaling in progress flag
- Last scale timestamp
- Pending/idle tracking
- Active scale-up action metadata

Conditional writes + distributed locking guarantee:

- No double scaling
- No race conditions
- Safe recovery from failures

---

## Security Model

- Cluster join token stored in **SSM Parameter Store**
- Kubernetes API token minted via ServiceAccount
- Lambda has **least-privilege IAM**
- No secrets baked into AMIs or code

---

## Observability

### Metrics

- Collected via Prometheus
- Queried directly by autoscaler

### Dashboards

- Cluster health
- Autoscaling decisions
- AZ distribution
- Spot stability

### Alerts

- Autoscaler failures
- Join timeouts
- Drain failures
- Spot replacement failures

No alert noise. Only actionable signals.

## What This Is (and Isn’t)

**This is:**

- A real autoscaler implementation
- Safe, explainable, and deterministic
- Suitable for small-to-medium clusters

**This is not:**

- A replacement for managed kubernetes service
- Tied to managed Kubernetes services auto-scaling

---

## Final Notes

This project intentionally prioritizes:

- **Safety over speed**
- **Correctness over cleverness**
- **Operational clarity over abstraction**

Every scaling decision can be explained after the fact, and that’s the point.

## Bonus Challenges

<br />

### Implemented

- **Multi-AZ awareness** for both scale-up and scale-down, ensuring balanced capacity and zone-level resilience
- **Spot instance usage with graceful interruption handling**, including fast drain, proactive termination, and AZ-aware on-demand fallback

### Not Implemeneted (Future Improvements)

- Predictive pre-scaling using historical workload trends
- Custom application level metrics (queue depth, latency, error rates)
- GitOps-style configuration management with versioned rollouts
- Pluggable notification system (e.g., Slack, webhooks, incident tools)

## Lab Environment Note

This project is designed to provision AWS resources via Pulumi (VPC, DynamoDB, EventBridge rules, SSM parameters, EC2 instances, etc.).

In the provided lab AWS account, some services/actions may be restricted (e.g., EventBridge rule creation and/or SSM Parameter Store SecureString creation).  
If Pulumi fails with permission errors, this is an environment limitation rather than an architecture limitation.

The autoscaler logic and infrastructure definitions remain valid and can be deployed successfully in a standard AWS account with the required permissions.

### Workaround Options

- Use existing pre-created SSM parameters (if provided) and reference by name or just hardcode it in the pulumi code.
- Skip EventBridge rules in lab and invoke Lambda manually for validation.
- Deploy the full stack in a personal AWS account with standard IAM permissions.xw
